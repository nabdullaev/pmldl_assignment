This folder is intended for storing any scripts or files related to datasets that might be used for training and testing machine learning models. 

However, in this case, the dataset used was the California Housing Dataset, which was directly loaded from a library (`sklearn.datasets`), so no raw dataset files were required or stored here.

Thus, this folder is left empty.
